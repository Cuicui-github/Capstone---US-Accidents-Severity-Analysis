# US-Accidents-Severity-Analysis
## Introduction
In this project, we plan to use a U.S. accident dataset to analyze which variables influence traffic accident severity.

Severity is defined as follows (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2000):

1: Low Impact: Vehicle/vehicles involved typically can be removed under their own power, possible but not necessary law enforcement, no injuries, 5-10 minutes 

2: Minor: Towing assistance necessary, law enforcement present, debris/fluid are seen, no injuries, 15-40 minutes

3: Moderate: Towing assistance necessary, law enforcement present, debris/fluid & potential fire hazard, possible injuries/fatalities, 20-60 minutes

4: Serious: Often several disabled vehicles likely in need of towing, law enforcement, possible need of EMS and Fire, debris may require special cleanup, represents incidents that last longer than a type 2 or 3, 40-60+ minutes
